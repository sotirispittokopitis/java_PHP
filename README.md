Description: Javalin and REST in the Project
Javalin Framework
- Javalin is a lightweight and flexible web framework for Java. It simplifies the creation of REST APIs and web applications. In this project, Javalin is used to define RESTful endpoints that allow interaction between the server (Java application) and the client (e.g., PHP or browser).

In this project:
* GET /api/send-json: Retrieves a JSON file from the server.
* POST /api/receive-json: Accepts JSON data from the client and saves it to the server.

Controller in Javalin
-  In a typical web application, a controller is responsible for handling client requests and determining the appropriate response. In this project:
* The RestController class acts as the controller.
* It defines the RESTful endpoints using Javalinâ€™s app.get and app.post methods.

Changes in the PHP File
-  The PHP file interacts with the Javalin server through RESTful API calls.
